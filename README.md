# PDiT

For enhanced decision making , perception transformers
were used along with Decision making transformers. To
optimise this, we can interleave Perception and Decision
Transformers . Using such PDiT involves different training
environments for different purposes. We shall explore
a particular scenario wherein an image based environment
exists in which an action is taken based on a text prompt. This
typically involves a not so efficient approach that does not
specifically correlate textual command with data in the images.

We are using the dataset:
